<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to deploy a project from the GitHub repository: . The initial request was to get the project running to see the visual interface, with the plan to progressively enhance and modify it.

Subsequent requests from the user included:
- Merging and aligning UI blocks on the Strategy page.
- Adding descriptive text for a Token Swap feature.
- Removing a Network information line.
- Restyling buttons to have rounded corners.
- Adding a Call to Action section at the bottom of the Strategy page.
- Conducting a UI/UX analysis of the Strategy page and implementing the suggestions (excluding chart modifications).
- Adding and styling tooltips across the application.
- Implementing mobile responsiveness for all pages (, , ), with a specific pattern of using horizontal scrolling for sections with multiple cards.
- Correcting tooltip styles and positions on the Auction page.
- Redesigning the Place Your Bid panel to be more dynamic and informative.

**User's preferred language**: Russian. The next agent MUST respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The project has been successfully cloned from GitHub, and both frontend and backend dependencies are installed. The services (frontend, backend, MongoDB) are running. The agent has performed numerous UI modifications and fixes as requested by the user, including implementing a significant portion of the mobile-responsive design. The application is viewable, but the last UI change was rejected by the user.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was working on redesigning the  component on the auction page. The user requested a more dynamic, informative, and visually appealing design without altering its dimensions. The agent's first attempt was rejected for being too colorful and not stylish enough.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done**: Y (User visually rejected the last implementation).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Redesign the  component (P0)**
  - **Description**: The user was unhappy with the last redesign of the  component, calling it a rainbow and lame. The task is to create a stylish, compact, and less multi-colored version. The user did like the inclusion of Hidden Bids and Early Bids information, so that concept should be retained but presented more elegantly.
  - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created a version with many different colors, which was immediately rejected by the user.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  View the file .
    2.  Simplify the color palette, adhering to the existing styles of the application (grays, a single primary/accent color).
    3.  Redesign the layout to be stylish and compact.
    4.  Integrate the Hidden Bids and Early Bids information in a subtle and clean manner.
    5.  Ensure the final design fits within the original component's dimensions.
    6.  After editing, use the screenshot tool to provide a visual for user approval.
  - **Why fix this issue?**: To meet the user's specific design request for a key interactive element on the Auction page.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **Task 1: Verify and Finalize Mobile Responsiveness (P1)**
        - **Description**: The agent has implemented mobile-responsive adaptations for most sections across the , , and  pages, primarily by adding horizontal scrolling for card lists. A complete visual review is required to ensure all pages are coherent, usable, and bug-free on mobile devices.
        - **Where to resume**: Systematically review each page (, , ) and its components on a small viewport size. Check for layout breaks, overflow issues, and inconsistent styling.
        - **What will be achieved**: A fully optimized and visually consistent mobile experience across the entire application.
        - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
        - **Should Test**: Frontend
        - **Blocked on something**: The current  issue should be resolved first.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Setup**:
  - Cloned project from GitHub and installed all backend and frontend dependencies.
  - Resolved startup errors related to missing modules (, ).
  - Confirmed all services are running and APIs are responsive.
- **UI/UX Enhancements (Strategy Page)**:
  - Merged and restyled stat blocks in .
  - Added and removed informational text as per user instructions in .
  - Standardized button styles () in .
  - Created and added a new  component.
  - Created a new  section based on a UI/UX analysis.
- **Tooltips Implementation & Fixes**:
  - Created a reusable  component.
  - Added tooltips to , , and .
  - Iteratively fixed tooltip styling (width, positioning, z-index, text wrapping) after multiple rounds of user feedback. The key fix was removing  from parent containers.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - Made numerous sections across , , and  pages mobile-friendly by implementing horizontal scrolling containers.
  - Made page layouts (e.g., ) adaptive by changing grid columns to stacked layouts on mobile.
  - Fixed a critical JSX syntax error in  that arose during refactoring.
- **UI Enhancements (Auction Page)**:
  - Standardized the styles of existing tooltips in , , and  to match the new global style.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Persistent ESLint Warnings**
  - **Debug checklist**: The frontend compilation consistently shows warnings, primarily . These should be fixed by adding the suggested missing dependencies to the dependency arrays of  and  hooks in the reported files (e.g., , ).
  - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Fixing these warnings improves code quality and prevents potential bugs related to stale state or unnecessary re-renders.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Frontend (check compilation logs for absence of warnings).
  - **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, framer-motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pymongo
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Process Management**: Supervisor

**key DB schema**
- Not explicitly defined, but API responses indicate collections related to strategy state, treasury, holders, and historical data.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : File for the current high-priority redesign task.
- : The global tooltip component that was heavily modified.
- : A component where  was removed to fix tooltip visibility.
- : A core page that received many UI/UX updates.
- : A core page where mobile responsiveness and tooltip fixes were applied.
- : The about page, adapted for mobile.
- : Modified to hide horizontal scrollbars for the custom scroll containers.
- Multiple component files under  and  were updated for mobile responsiveness.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The mobile responsiveness was applied piecemeal. A unified review is needed to ensure consistency.
- The tooltip implementation required multiple fixes, suggesting the CSS is fragile. The  and  properties in various components might need a more systematic approach to prevent future layout issues.

**key api endpoints**
- : Backend health check.
- : Fetches data for the Strategy page.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User Interaction**: The user is highly visual and direct. Always provide screenshots for UI changes. Acknowledge feedback clearly and act on it precisely.
- **Design Sense**: The user prefers stylish and compact designs. Avoid overly colorful (rainbow) aesthetics.
- **Tooltip Saga**: The main issue with tooltips was that they were being clipped by parent containers with . The fix is to remove this property from the parents of elements that have tooltips. Tooltips should also appear above their trigger element () and have a high .
- **Mobile Design Pattern**: For sections containing a list of cards, the user's preferred mobile pattern is a horizontal scrolling container with .
- **Chart Components**: Do not modify the chart components. The user has stated they are integrated from an external tool () and cannot be customized.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : A temporary UI/UX analysis report.
